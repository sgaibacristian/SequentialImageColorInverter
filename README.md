**Project: Image Color Inversion using OpenCV**

**Project Requirements/Theme:**
The project involves developing a mini-application that inverses the colors of an image. This is achieved using the color inversion algorithm implemented in C++ with the help of the OpenCV library. The algorithm iterates through each pixel of the image and inverses the color component values, resulting in an image that is the original image with inverted colors.

**Machine Information:**
Processor: 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700H @ 2.30 GHz
Installed RAM: 16.0 GB (15.7 GB usable)
System Type: Windows 11 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor


**Experimental Results:**
Execution Time: 0.068 seconds.
Average Execution Time: 0.0075 seconds
These experimental results indicate that the implemented algorithm runs efficiently and quickly, even on a system with moderate resources, producing the desired results in a very short time.
